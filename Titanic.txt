#### **Introduction**
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset that provides information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. The dataset contains details such as passenger demographics, ticket class, fare, and survival status. This analysis explores various aspects of the dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger survival rates.

#### **Data Overview**
The Titanic dataset includes several features:
- **PassengerId:** Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived:** Indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
- **Pclass:** Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- **Name:** Name of the passenger.
- **Sex:** Gender of the passenger.
- **Age:** Age of the passenger.
- **SibSp:** Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch:** Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket:** Ticket number.
- **Fare:** Passenger fare.
- **Cabin:** Cabin number.
- **Embarked:** Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
The analysis included the following key visualizations and statistical analyses:

1. **Distribution of Passenger Ages:**
   - A histogram showing the age distribution of passengers. Most passengers were between 20 and 40 years old, with a noticeable decline in passengers as age increases.

2. **Distribution of Passenger Fares:**
   - A histogram revealing the distribution of fares paid by passengers. The fare distribution is right-skewed, with most passengers paying lower fares.

3. **Survival Rates by Passenger Class:**
   - A grouped bar chart displaying survival rates across different passenger classes. First-class passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to second and third-class passengers.

4. **Survival Rates by Gender:**
   - A grouped bar chart illustrating survival rates by gender. Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than male passengers, highlighting the "women and children first" protocol during the disaster.

5. **Correlation Heatmap:**
   - A heatmap showing correlations between numerical features. The most notable correlations were between fare and class, as well as between siblings/spouses aboard and parents/children aboard.

6. **Scatter Matrix (Pairplot):**
   - A scatter plot matrix displaying relationships between various numerical features. This visualization helped in understanding how features like age, fare, and passenger class relate to each other and survival outcomes.

#### **Advanced Statistical Analysis**
In addition to visualizations, the analysis included hypothesis testing and feature importance analysis:

1. **T-Test on Age and Survival:**
   - A t-test was conducted to compare the ages of survivors and non-survivors. The test suggested that the age difference between survivors and non-survivors was statistically significant.

2. **Chi-Squared Test on Class and Survival:**
   - A chi-squared test was performed to examine the relationship between passenger class and survival. The results confirmed a significant relationship, with higher classes having better survival rates.

3. **Feature Importance Analysis using Random Forest:**
   - A Random Forest model was trained to predict survival. The feature importance analysis indicated that passenger class, fare, and age were among the most important features influencing survival.

#### **Interactive Dashboard**
An interactive dashboard was created using Dash, providing a user-friendly interface for exploring the Titanic dataset. The dashboard includes:
- **Tabs for Different Analyses:**
  - **Age and Fare Distribution**: Visualizes the distribution of passenger ages and fares.
  - **Survival by Class and Gender**: Highlights survival rates across different classes and genders.
  - **Correlation Heatmap**: Displays the correlations between numerical features.
  - **Scatter Matrix**: Shows pairwise relationships between selected features.
- **Custom Styling:**
  - The dashboard features a centered title, and each tab is color-coded to enhance the visual appeal.

#### **Conclusion**
The analysis provided key insights into the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic. Passenger class and gender were particularly significant, with first-class passengers and females having a higher likelihood of survival. The interactive dashboard allows users to explore these findings further and gain a deeper understanding of the dataset.
